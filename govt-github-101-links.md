### Worklow & Branching Strategies
A few links to various sites and discussions of branching strategies I share with users who have questions. In general, I suggest branches be created for all bug fixes and new features, and if it is a particularly large change, you can have a "branch of branches."

* Worth reading: The **original** work on Git branching strategies (I now find this outdated and overly complicated): [nvie.com](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
* High level overview of GitHub Flow: [readthedocs.io](https://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git-branching-strategies/githubflow/)
* Good article using a development branch and GitHub Flow: [medium.com](https://medium.com/@robnich/a-branching-and-releasing-strategy-that-fits-github-flow-be1b6c48eca2#.kohcw2ga3)
