## GitHub Data Science Resources

As you know, the Data Science use case is actually one that we see quite often. When looking outside the Federal portfolio, AirBnB is a great example of an organization that created a knowledge sharing workflow for their Data Science teams on top of GitHub. Participation in this workflow has increased 2,000% since it was first introduced, and productivity has grown in turn. Data Science can, and does, work on top of GitHub, and is actually a driver in many organizations today. In an effort to try to capture and share some of the insights we've learned to the wider community, we partnered with O'Reilly media last year to produce a book (well, more like a long pamphlet) around some of the best practices for Data Science and GitHub. We've also recently hosted webinars around this topic, so I've included those resources below. What's really interesting is the unification of data and software engineers of late (which I'm sure you can attest to first hand). While data professionals continue to use a variety of tools depending on their tasks, goals, and skills (i.e. familiarity with complex data pipelines for one), they are clearly showing preference to tools used traditionally in software developments practices ([Source](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/8-data-trends-on-our-radar-for-2017)). This is just another reason why (along with Infrastructure, Security/Testing, and project management) that modern version control platforms are more than just what is easiest (or cheapest) for developers, but what will best support the entire Enterprise for the years to come.

> At the intersection of science and software, data scientists are uniquely positioned to adopt best practices from both fields. The team at Datascope Analytics adapts the fundamentals of open source software development to fit their workflow.

Open source development helps Datascope share ideas and build on the work of others.

> Learn best practices for tracking and organizing data science work in repositories from the experts at GitHub and DataScience.com.

> Although data science is behind many successful information strategies, data scientists work differently than other IT professionals. Despite these differences, it's more important than ever for data scientists to work seamlessly with their IT peers on data-based solutions.

Hopefully these resources can go along way to showing that GitHub has a place in many workflows, including those focusing on languages like R and Python (and don't forget the Juypter Notebook integration too!).
